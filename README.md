# js-speed-cube
Vanilla Js Speed "Snake". Instead of tail we inrease speed of player with every eaten fruit.
Actual back story of this is that i wanted to make simple snake game but after few features coding i decided i will increase speed instead of creating longer tail.
After showing to my friends it just really hitted them and after few weeks i and 10-20 players every day (Google Analytics). Maybe it was small succes but i really embrace it!

## What i learned?
* canvas drawing
* creating simply games in js without libraries
